    "\n",
    "### What we learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parameter Efficiency**: LoRa only trains <1% of the original model parameters\n",
    "2. **Effectiveness**: Significant improvement in task performance\n",
    "3. **Speed**: Much faster training compared to full fine-tuning\n",
    "4. **Memory**: Lower GPU memory requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### LoRa Parameters Impact:\n",
    "- **`r` (rank)**: Higher values = more parameters, potentially better performance\n",
    "- **`lora_alpha`**: Controls the scaling of LoRa adaptation\n",
    "- **`target_modules`**: Which layers to adapt (attention modules work well)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Try different datasets and tasks\n",
    "- Experiment with different LoRa configurations\n",
    "- Compare with full fine-tuning\n",
    "- Use larger models (e.g., Llama, GPT-style models)"
